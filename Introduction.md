# Data structures and algorithms


## Introduction
This repository is intended to help the ones who are looking for learning some important data structures and algorithms. I will share the content I have been using the last 5 years to learn those topics and help others to learn as a teaching assistant.

### Studying materials
The idea is to share some files, videos, chapter of books and exercises from sites I use for practicing. For the theoretical part I enjoy the YouTube Channels:

- [Stanford Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH4s4ek5zqNvct5oy9_jd_g/featured)
- [MaratonUSP](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB_SQAulqgmQ0Vfww9wzfWA) - Portuguese

The application of algorithms I recommend reading the books:

- [Competitive Programming 3: The New Lower Bound of Programming Contests](https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Programming-3rd-Steven-Halim/dp/B00FG8MNN8)
- [Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions](https://www.amazon.com.br/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=asc_df_0984782850/?tag=googleshopp00-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=379712558847&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15230358440843856949&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1001625&hvtargid=pla-388890317700&psc=1)

There are some YouTube channels I follow that helps:
- [CS Dojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A)
- [Byte By Byte](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWSYAntBbdd2SLYUqPIxo0w)
- [Tech Dummies Narendra L](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn1XnDWhsLS5URXTi5wtFTA)
- [Tushar Roy - Coding Made Simple](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZLJf_R2sWyUtXSKiKlyvAw)

To pursue these materials is necessary to have knowledge of the basis programming skill
