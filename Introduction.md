# Data structures and algorithms


## Introduction
This repository is intended to help the ones who are looking for learning some important data structures and algorithms. I will share the content I have been using the last 5 years to learn those topics and help others to learn as a teaching assistant.

### Studying materials
The idea is to share some files, videos, chapter of books and exercises from sites I use for practicing. For the theoretical part I enjoy the YouTube Channels:

- [Stanford Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH4s4ek5zqNvct5oy9_jd_g/featured) 
- [MaratonUSP](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB_SQAulqgmQ0Vfww9wzfWA)
